## Background of Tool

This tool is developed since the school required each video should have subtitles. Every coin has two sides, Premiere Pro can import .srt file, which more easy to generate subtitles rather than copying the Legacy Title (text card) manually or using UI path machines. However, you should import a strict format with the actual syntax of the file to Premiere Pro, which easily messes it up.

So, I invent (make) a tool for me (or those in need), to generate .srt file more friendly. Save more time and cost.

### Tool compatibility

### Pre-request of use
1. Python installed SDK (is recommended); or, Python on command-line
2. A .txt file named "subtitle.txt" placed at the same path of .py
