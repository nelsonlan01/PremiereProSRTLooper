## Background of Tool
This tool is develop since school reqired each video should have subtitle. Every coin have two side, Premiere Pro can import .srt file, which more easy to generate subtitle rather than copy Legacy Title (text card) manually or using UI path machines. However, you should import a strict formatted with actual syntax of file to Premiere Pro, which easily mess it up.

So, I invent (make) a tool for me (or those in need), to generate .srt file more friendly. Save more time and cost.

### Tool compatibility

### Pre-request of use
1. Python installed SDK (is recommended); or, Python on command-line
2. A .txt file named as "subtitle.txt" place at the same path of .py
